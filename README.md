This is a simple rag without using any frameworks.
In this I have used 'paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2' model in order to create vector embedddings (which are not normalized i.e. not in the range of 0 to 1).
These vector embeddings are stored in the same dataframe as the sentence chunks are.
Finally, the search results page is displayed at last.
